<p>This set of Panasonic speakers only cost <abbr title="New Zealand Dollar">NZD</abbr>$20! They often have old electronics that people do not have a use for anymore, and these speakers are a great example of that. For some reason they did not come with the original amp stereo thing, which is something I've noticed with these <abbr title="Opportunity Shop, thrift store, second hand store">Op</abbr> shop speakers.</p>


<p>Thankfully, I had an old Toshiba home theatre amplifier/receiver lying around. Luckily it had an optical connection! <!--insert picture of optical connector !-->That means we can easily connect it to our Samsung TV.  <br>
The speaker connections were just bare wires so we tried connection that to the amp but the wires would often fall off and make a loud high pitched noise. It even sparked a little! <br></p>
<img src="/assets/images/speakers/amplifierconnectors.jpg"><aside><p><i>This old Toshiba amp has an optical in, multiple RCA in and S-video. It even has DVD/CD capability and a FM/AM radio tuner! However since it was made in 2003 it has no HDMI whatsoever.</i></p></aside>
<p>I went to Jaycar to see if there was anything that would connect to these connectors but unfortunately there was nothing. I resorted to using alligator clips to connect the speakers somewhat securely to the connections.</p><img src="/assets/images/speakers/aligaterclips.jpg" width="320" height="180">
<p>When I connected it to the TV it decided that 5.1 surround sound was the way. I went on disney+ and watched a trailer for a new Star Wars show and I couldn't hear any dialogue! I realised that the system thought I had a centre speaker so I had to go into the Tizen OS Settings and turn off Dolby Atmos and go back to plain old <abbr title="Pulse-Code Modulation">PCM</abbr>.</p>
<p>The subwoofer was quite loud and punchy for its size; and comparing that system to TV speakers is cruel. They don't stand a chance!<br>
    The receiver has a few sound modes I had a play with. Prologic seems to get a psuedo surrond, which is usefull if you had rear speakers and TV doesn't have surrond sound. Then there is Hall 1 and 2. These add reverb to make it seem like you are in a bigger room. Lastly, there is theater. It makes it sound quieter, but I think it does the same as prologic and incorporates the rear speakers (if I had them).
   <br> Overall, I think I scored and epic system for way cheaper than a sound bar, and I'm pretty sure soundbars don't sound as good, simply because the speakers are smaller.</p>]]></content><author><name>Hunter Pickett</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This set of Panasonic speakers only cost NZD$20!
